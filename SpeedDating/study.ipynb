    "# Speed Date Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project üöß\n",
    "The marketing team needs help on a new project. They are experiencing a decrease in the number of matches, and they are trying to find a way to understand what makes people interested into each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "They decided to run a speed dating experiment with people who had to give Tinder lots of informations about themselves that could ultimately reflect on ther dating profile on the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tinder then gathered the data from this experiment. Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people, and indicates wether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals üéØ\n",
    "Use the dataset to understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may use descriptive statistics\n",
    "- You may use visualisations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of this project üñºÔ∏è\n",
    "Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute \"first date\" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information. See the Speed Dating Data Key document below for details."
